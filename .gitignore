# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it's recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, if you have a good reason to ignore it, uncomment the line below.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it's generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   However, if you have a good reason to ignore it, uncomment the line below.
# poetry.lock
# .python-version

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it's generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#   However, if you have a good reason to ignore it, uncomment the line below.
# pdm.lock
# .pdm-python

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow and github.com/pdm-project/pdm
